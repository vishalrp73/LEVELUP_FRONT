FRONT END REPOSITORY for LevelUp Works Application

Built as a final project for Misison Ready HQ.
To be used with back-end repository (also pinned).

The application is for students learning to code and contains a student/teacher side entry point.
Authentication currently works but needs a lot of work restructuring / security considerations to be production-ready.

Material UI was used for drawers and modals.
